openjpeg (an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language)

It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, a
still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts
Group (JPEG). Since May 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC
and ITU-T as a JPEG 2000 Reference Software.

The code is released under the 2-clauses BSD license.
